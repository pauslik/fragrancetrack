This is a personal fragrance review tracker (some features still in development)
You can add any fragrance you own or tried with your score and it will get the public score along with other information about the fragrance.

Public information is pulled from Fragrantica and only for personal use. Only getting a few links and downloading the card image directly, need to look for options on reducing the traffic even more.

TODO: add web interface with search and display functionality

WARNING: the import option for the database is not very reliable because the search results Algolia provides are pretty bad
